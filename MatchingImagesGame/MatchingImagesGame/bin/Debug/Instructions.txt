Game rules: 
This is a memory-based game.
You must connect all squares with the same image.
Once you click on two squares, the images of those squares will reveal.
If the images are the same - you have discovered a pair.
If they are not the same - they will be hidden again in a second.
You operate within two-click "rounds".

Have Fun!
